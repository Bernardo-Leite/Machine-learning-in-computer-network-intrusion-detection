# Machine-learning-in-computer-network-intrusion-detection
This project consists of detecting whether a system is being attacked and, in the event of an attack, it must distinguish what type of attack was used. To distinguish and detect different types of attacks, different Machine Learning models were developed and analyzed.

- Regression 
- Ensembles
- Support Vector Machines
- Artificial Neural Networks
